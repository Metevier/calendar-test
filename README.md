# Prosoft Programming Exercise

For this excercise I am using React, Angular's competitor created by Facebook, and Bootstrap. I am also
using moment.js, which is a date library, as javascript's default date support is not too good.

Relevent code is located in app.js and app.css.

To run the code, just spin up any web server from this directory, then navigate to localhost. Ex:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
